## Bugs

### Users are unable to set task due date ###
**Fix:**   
Add Due Date field, which was missing from API

### Due date reverts to current date, regardless of the date selected in the date picker ###
**Fix:**  
Set `auto_now=False` in Task model

### When task status is set to COMPLETED, the display reads "invalid date" until page is reloaded ###
**Fix:**  
Added
`completed_date: newStatus === "Completed" ? new Date() : null,` to the `submitForm` function.

This change ensures that `completed_date` is properly formatted and prevents the "Invalid Date" message.

### Profile task count always displays 10, until result 11+ are loaded via InfiniteScroll component ###
**Fix:**  
Replace `const profileTaskCount = profileTasks.results.length;` with `const profileTaskCount = profileTasks.count;`  
and `const assignedTaskCount = assignedTasks.results.length;` with `const assignedTaskCount = assignedTasks.count;`
